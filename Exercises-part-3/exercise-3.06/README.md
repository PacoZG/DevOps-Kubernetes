Exercise 3.06: DBaaS vs DIY
========

## Database as a service (DBaaS) is a cloud computing managed service offering that provides access to a database without requiring the setup of physical hardware, the installation of software or the need to configure the database. Most maintenance and administrative tasks are handled by the service provider, freeing up users to quickly benefit from using the database.

- Advantages of DBaaS

  - Reduced management requirements -- the DBaaS provider takes on many management and administrative burdens.
  - Elimination of physical infrastructure -- the infrastructure required to run the database is provided by the DBaaS provider.
  -  Reduced IT costs -- users do not need to manage and plan for database hardware upgrades.
  - Increased savings -- users do not need to invest in costly hardware, because the physical infrastructure is no longer on premises. Additional savings can also come from reduced capital expenditures, less staff, decreased electrical and HVACoperating costs and a smaller physical space.

- Disadvantages of DBaaS

  - Lack of control over the software and hardware infrastructure is usually the most significant issue with DBaaS versus an in-house solution. In a provider-managed infrastructure, an organization's technicians do not have direct access to the servers and storage used to run the database.

  - Possible organization's internet connection systems outages.

  - Lack of direct control over security

  - Potential latency due to loading large amounts of data, which tends to be slow and time-consuming.

## DIY (Do It Yourself) database is a database that it is build in house from scratch, using all the resources that the user can provide, like an team of developers that will provide maintainance to the infrastructure, etc.

<br>

- Advantages of DIY-DB

  - Good adaptability to your personal needs

  - Great control over the development, maintainability and security of the infrastructure

<br>

- Disadvantages of DIY-DB

  - High cost of staffing, the cost of hiring capable developers to maintain the infrastructure. Building, deploying, and maintaining a database-as-a-service system requires developers with specialized coding skills, network engineers, and IT support staff

  - Time of solving the problems internally can also be a disadvantage

  - High costs of in-house infrastructure
